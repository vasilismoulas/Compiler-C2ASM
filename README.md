# Compiler-C2ASM
 Transforming C code into optimized, platform-specific assembly language, our compiler seamlessly bridges the gap between human-readable code and machine-level instructions. With an emphasis on efficiency and portability, it empowers developers to unlock the full potential of their C programs while retaining fine-grained control over the generated assembly output. Whether you're delving into system-level programming or optimizing critical algorithms, our compiler streamlines the process, offering a robust toolset for software development and optimization.
